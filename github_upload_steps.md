# How to Upload Your M&A Global Files to GitHub (iPad)

## Your Files Are Ready!

All the files for your M&A Global app are in your current project. You need to upload these to GitHub:

### Files to Upload:
- `package.json`
- `app.json` 
- `eas.json`
- All files in the `app/` folder
- All files in the `components/` folder  
- All files in the `constants/` folder
- All files in the `hooks/` folder

## Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (iPad Friendly)

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to **github.com** on your iPad
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `ma-global-app`
4. Make it **Public** (easier for Expo)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. In your new repository, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. **Drag and drop** or **choose files** from your project
3. Upload these key files first:
   - `package.json`
   - `app.json`
   - `eas.json`

### Step 3: Create Folders
1. Click **"Create new file"**
2. Type `app/index.tsx` (this creates the app folder)
3. Copy the content from your `app/index.tsx` file
4. Commit the file
5. Repeat for other folders: `components/`, `constants/`, `hooks/`

## Method 2: Use GitHub Desktop (If Available)

If you can install GitHub Desktop:
1. Clone your new repository
2. Copy all your project files into the cloned folder
3. Commit and push

## Method 3: Ask for Help

Since you're on iPad, you might want to:
1. **Share your project files** with someone who has a computer
2. **Ask them to upload** to GitHub for you
3. **Give them your GitHub login** (temporarily)

## After Upload

Once your files are on GitHub:
1. Go back to **expo.dev/accounts/mylesb1969/projects/mandaglobal**
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **GitHub**  
3. **Link your repository**: `ma-global-app`
4. The **"Create build"** button will appear!

## Your Repository URL
After creating, it will be:
`https://github.com/mylesb1969/ma-global-app`

## Need the Files?

Your project files are in your current development environment. If you can't access them:
1. **Download from your development server**
2. **Export from your code editor**
3. **Or ask me to provide them again**

The key is getting these files from where you're developing to GitHub!
